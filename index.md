## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs


#Lab 7, part 2:
 was one of my favorite labs from this semester. I am an avid car player, so this one really spoke to me because it entailed something that I enjoy. I have played a lot of blackjack with others, so an automated scoring system was really quite nice.

#Lab 12, part 2 :
was another one of my favorite labs this year because it entailed doing something that I have always wanted to do, making an animation. While it was just a simple one, it was using programming rather than an engine. This really shows some of the power of C and other languages beyond their most basic practices.

#Lab 3, part 2 :
was very interesting because it was the first time when we started extensively using functions. THis was the first time I saw their time saving potential. It also was a somewhat useful system, being able to calculate the days between 2 points is not easy to do.
